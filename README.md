# RayW_VNTool
Hi! So, I'm really proud of what I was able to get done so far in my project. Even after class I want to expand on the tool for later use. 
I wanted to get a lot more done, which is clear by my planning document. 

I had some trouble figuring out how to make the system read commands within text files. 
I tried to add that in but it just ended up making the tool not work, so I had to trash the files and go back to my previous saved work. 
I also attempted the save/load system but that required it to save a lot of game data. Including: game text, character sprites, background, etc. 
That required a whole other system to first save that data before I could then even make it so you could load it up or save your progress. 
I tried my hand at a lot of things I ended up having to scrap because of time. 

Despite that I hope my work shows that I tried my best to make this tool functional above all else. 
Even though I did slack a lot on my last few projects I really enjoyed the class and worked hard on this one so I can hopefully pass and take Scripting II.
